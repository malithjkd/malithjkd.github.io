### Haptic based surface stiffness identification using deep learning 

Vision-based approaches are widely used in research to classify objects. However, there are specifications of deformable objects that are difficult to classify using vision-based sensors, such as vegetables that look good on the outside but are rotten on the inside, ripe or unripe fruits, and objects made to mimic real objects.

The feel of the objects may reveal the distinguishing characteristics of the object or the state of the object, which may help to classify them. Haptic-based object classification has gained popularity in recent years. However, the majority of object classification studies only use sensory information for classification. The goal of my research is to construct a few additional features for object classification and identify the best performing feature set.

### Operation of a grid connected microgrid with a variable load bus and a diesel generator set

Microgrids can helps to stabilise the national grid and absorb much renewable power. So, to export and import energy at predefined levels at steady phase, micro-grids need to adapt to a dynamic governor control to the swing bus. In our project we designed and developed a diesel generator governor which responds to the load changes inside the microgrid and keeps a steady phase of electricity export or imports to the national electricity grid. Developed governor is tested on an 11kVA diesel generator which is connected to the PI transmission line model with multiple 3 kVA loads.
