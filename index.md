### Haptic based surface stiffness identification using machine learning

Vision-based approaches are extensively employed in research to classify objects. However, there are specific characteristics of deformable objects that are challenging to classify using vision-based sensors. Examples include vegetables that may seem fresh externally but are rotten internally, ripe or unripe fruits, and objects designed to mimic real-life objects. In such cases, the texture or feel of the object may reveal distinct characteristics or its state, which may facilitate classification.

Unfortunately, the majority of object classification studies rely solely on sensory information for classification. The objective of my research is to introduce additional features for object classification and identify the optimal performing feature set. Furthermore, we aim to use time series forest classifier machine learning models to classify the objects.

### Operation of a grid connected microgrid with a variable load bus and a diesel generator set

Microgrids can helps to stabilise the national grid and absorb much renewable power. So, to export and import energy at predefined levels at steady phase, micro-grids need to adapt to a dynamic governor control to the swing bus. In our project we designed and developed a diesel generator governor which responds to the load changes inside the microgrid and keeps a steady phase of electricity export or imports to the national electricity grid. Developed governor is tested on an 11kVA diesel generator which is connected to the PI transmission line model with multiple 3 kVA loads.
